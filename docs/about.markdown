## Summary

The Bike Share Case Study is the capstone assignment of the Google Data Analytics Certificate. Its completion marks my successful conclusion of the course and helps showcase some of the skills I have obtained.

## Description of Case Study

In the Bike Share case study, the historical [Ridership Record](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) of the fictional company Cyclistics is examined to provide insights about its bike-sharing service in the Chicago area. In specific, differences in the usage of the bike-share service between casual and member riders are explored. These insights would supposedly help inform an upcoming marketing campaign.

The case study is carried out in four steps. First, the necessary raw data from Cyclistics is downloaded and cleaned (1). The cleaned data is then transformed (2) and visualized (3) to address relevant aspects of Cyclistics' ride-share service. Finally, the insights are documented in a final report (4).

All steps of the case study are carried out using the programming language R due to its ease of use, versatility, cost efficiency, as well as the high availability of communities and resources.
